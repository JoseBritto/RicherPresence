2. Give it a good name.

> You donot need to create a bot user.

3. Now go to art assets and upload the images that you need to be displayed on you profile.

> Make sure to give short and memorable names to the images.

4. Save the changes

5. Now if you reload the page you will see that the images have disappeared. Don't worry, discord is processing them. This usually takes around 20 minutes. So wait for 20 minutes and reload the page to them again.

> While you wait download [RicherPresence]() and [.Net 5](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/8bc41df1-cbb4-4da6-944f-6652378e9196/1014aacedc80bbcc030dabb168d2532f/windowsdesktop-runtime-5.0.9-win-x64.exe

6. After the images are done processing. You can move on to the visualizer tab. Here you can see a preview of what others might see on your profile.

7. Now you can open up Richer Presence and fill in the values.

> Just be aware that by default Richer Presence minimizes to tray when it closes. So you have to click exit on the tray icon to actually close it.
